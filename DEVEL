== Beah - Beaker Harness ==

Harness is using TCP/IP sockets for IPC. In case of failures it is easy to
reconnect. (At least easier than simple capturing stdout.)

Events and Commands are JSON-serialized new-line separated messages sent over
TCP/IP socket. Easy to extend, easy to ignore parts of message which are not
understood. Well supported in many programming languages. Rather effective
enconding/decoding.

Single JSON object on a line, is quite robust: in case of message corruption
only that message (and eventually next one) will be affected. In case of
events, these will not be lost - the lose_item event containing raw data is
generated.

Twisted framework is used for handling non-blocking I/O operations.
