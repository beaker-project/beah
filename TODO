== TODO ==

 !  beaker backend
 !  rhts task adaptor
 !  go on with refactoring - identify duplicates, useless stuff, patterns.
 9  twisted scaffolding for controller, backend and task.
    - I/O - sockets, stdio, named-pipes
    - spawn process
 9  library of common methods for download, install, check and uninstall tasks
 9  backends should end cleanly when "bye" is received.
 9  check compatibility with older distributions and ms windows
 9  proper configuration files (host,port), default backend, using timestamps
 9  command line options for server
 9  make it a service (service beacon start...)
 9  fedora packaging
 8  add support for other programming languages - convenience directory.
    - interfaces should be generated from metadata
    - interfaces should use keyword/value (or --option=value) for all obscure
      choices, so it is easy to extend, backward compatible.
      Use positional arguments only for obvious always present arguments.
      Provide wrappers for most common tasks - e.g. simple logging,...
 8  more documentation
 8  support for reboot - after rebooting:
    - set-up environment, start the controller, initialise backends, and start
      tasks.
 7  identify common formats (e.g. cppunit) and create filters
 4  create filter taking stdin and sending to Controller via socket
    - tee for sockets
 4  output backend w/ colorful output.

=== Testing ===

 9  Test Twisted XML-RPC beaviour, when connection is lost
    - are incoming requests queued?
    - is their order preserved?
    Configure retries

=== Legend ===
