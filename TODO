== TODO ==

 !  test 'python setup.py install' + rpms
    - almost works :-)
      - yum install python python-{simplejson,zope-interface,twisted-{core,web}}
    - there is no Twisted egg when doing "yum install python-twisted"
      - there are Twisted_Web and Twisted_Core egg's :-/
      - setuptools install_requires does not work
    - could not get packages from pypi :-(
      - 1. try building a package on LM and saving somewhere on intranet
      - 2. installing (and running) beah
    - check setup.py in twisted!
 !  check if original Fedora spec's could be used
    - CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@cvs.fedora.redhat.com:/cvs/pkgs cvs co rpms/{python,python-zope-interface,python-simplejson,python-twisted-{core,web}}/{F-10,devel}
 !  rhts task adaptor
 !  fix task_id - when using socket for communication (use same task_info as
    task in controller.tasks)
    - task has to send "introduce" event, as controller has no way to identify
      task connecting this way.
 !  communication backend/controller->task
    - stdin/socket?
 !  proper configuration files (host,port), default backend, using timestamps
 !  command line options for executables
 !  fedora packaging
    - create brew/koji build
    - download python src, build and install
    - download dependencies and install
    - install
 !  library of common methods for download, install, check and uninstall tasks
 !  go on with refactoring - identify duplicates, useless stuff, patterns.
 !  add a command_id to command and use it to identify echo-events.
    - some events (espacially those expecting results) should have event_id as
      well - e.g. sync-block when done.
 !  run pylint and clean up the code!
 9  clean up backends/server output
    - use logging
    - remove message generated by default, but allow to turn logging on/off.
 9  twisted scaffolding for controller, backend and task.
    - I/O - sockets, stdio, named-pipes
    - spawn process
 9  backends should end cleanly when "bye" is received.
 9  check compatibility with older distributions and ms windows
    - one can simply download and build newer python, even on RHEL 3.
    - test AS2.1 and MS W32
      - W32 - see https://winland.englab.brq.redhat.com/shepherd/list.cgi
 9  make it a service (service beacon start...)
 8  add support for other programming languages - convenience directory.
    - interfaces should be generated from metadata
    - interfaces should use keyword/value (or --option=value) for all obscure
      choices, so it is easy to extend, backward compatible.
      Use positional arguments only for obvious always present arguments.
      Provide wrappers for most common tasks - e.g. simple logging,...
 8  more documentation
 8  support for reboot - after rebooting:
    - set-up environment, start the controller, initialise backends, and start
      tasks.
 7  identify common formats (e.g. cppunit) and create filters
 4  create filter taking stdin and sending to Controller via socket
    - tee for sockets
 4  output backend w/ colorful output.

=== Testing ===

 9  Test Twisted XML-RPC beaviour, when connection is lost
    - are incoming requests queued?
    - is their order preserved?
    Configure retries

=== Legend ===
