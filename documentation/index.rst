Discussions
~~~~~~~~~~~

The best way to interact with Beaker and the Beah developers and users is in the `#beaker 
<irc://chat.freenode.net/beaker>`_ IRC channel on irc.freenode.net. The Beaker 
developers monitor this channel, and development discussions often happen 
there. Alternatively, you can post your question to the `beaker-devel 
<https://fedorahosted.org/mailman/listinfo/beaker-devel>`_ mailing list.


Reporting a bug
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you've found a bug in Beah, please report it in `Red Hat Bugzilla 
<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/enter_bug.cgi?product=Beaker>`__ against the
