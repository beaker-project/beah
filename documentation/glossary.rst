   Controller
       It is a center piece of harness. It is used to process
       Commands from Backends, spawn Tasks and process Events from Tasks, and
       eventually forwarding these to Backends.

   Backend
       It is a client which connects to Controller and which can issue Commands
       (read from console or socket) and is processing Events (writing to console or
       to file, to internet socket etc.) Multiple Backends can be connected to a
       single Controller.

   Task
       It is an executable, which runs a test and is generating Events as a
       result, sending these to the Controller server. It can use either stdout or
       socket to send events to Controller. stderr is captured as well, but is
       considered a raw-data (creating lose_item events.)

   Event
       It is a piece of information generated by running Task (e.g. log-event,
       result-event) or Controller (e.g. pong-event, bye-event) and sent to Backend.

   Command
       It is a piece of information instructing Controller (and eventually
       Task) to perform an operation (e.g. run-command to spawn a new Task or
       kill-command killing a Controller server)

   Test 
       It is an executable performing testing producing output in known format.
       Task adaptor has to be written to translate this output to sequence of Events.
